          "text": "Let's break this down step by step!\n\nFirst, we need to understand the total number of digits displayed and the range of times.\n\n1.  **Total Number of Times:**\n    *   Hours: 00 to 23 (24 unique hours)\n    *   Minutes: 00 to 59 (60 unique minutes)\n    *   Total unique times = 24 hours * 60 minutes = 1440 times.\n\n2.  **Total Number of Digits Displayed:**\n    *   Each time (e.g., 00:00, 12:34) consists of 4 digits.\n    *   Total digits displayed = 1440 times * 4 digits/time = 5760 digits.\n    *   This will be our denominator for percentage calculations.\n\nNow, let's count the occurrences of each digit (0-9) by considering the hours and minutes separately.\n\n---\n\n### Counting Digits in Hours (HH)\n\nWe need to count how many times each digit appears in the \"HH\" part across all 24 hours (00 to 23).\nLet's consider the tens digit (H1) and the units digit (H2) for each hour.\n\n*   **H1 (Tens Digit of Hour):**\n    *   '0' appears 10 times (in 00, 01, ..., 09)\n    *   '1' appears 10 times (in 10, 11, ..., 19)\n    *   '2' appears 4 times (in 20, 21, 22, 23)\n    *   (Other digits: 0 times)\n\n*   **H2 (Units Digit of Hour):**\n    *   From 00-09: Each digit (0-9) appears once.\n    *   From 10-19: Each digit (0-9) appears once.\n    *   From 20-23: Digits (0, 1, 2, 3) appear once.\n    *   So, total H2 counts:\n        *   '0': 1 (from 00-09) + 1 (from 10-19) + 1 (from 20-23) = 3 times\n        *   '1': 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 times\n        *   '2': 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 times\n        *   '3': 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 times\n        *   '4': 1 + 1 = 2 times\n        *   '5': 1 + 1 = 2 times\n        *   '6': 1 + 1 = 2 times\n        *   '7': 1 + 1 = 2 times\n        *   '8': 1 + 1 = 2 times\n        *   '9': 1 + 1 = 2 times\n\n*   **Total Occurrences for each digit in the HH part across 24 hours:**\n    *   Digit 0: 10 (H1) + 3 (H2) = 13 times\n    *   Digit 1: 10 (H1) + 3 (H2) = 13 times\n    *   Digit 2: 4 (H1) + 3 (H2) = 7 times\n    *   Digit 3: 0 (H1) + 3 (H2) = 3 times\n    *   Digit 4: 0 (H1) + 2 (H2) = 2 times\n    *   Digit 5: 0 (H1) + 2 (H2) = 2 times\n    *   Digit 6: 0 (H1) + 2 (H2) = 2 times\n    *   Digit 7: 0 (H1) + 2 (H2) = 2 times\n    *   Digit 8: 0 (H1) + 2 (H2) = 2 times\n    *   Digit 9: 0 (H1) + 2 (H2) = 2 times\n\n---\n\n### Counting Digits in Minutes (MM)\n\nNow, we need to count how many times each digit appears in the \"MM\" part across all 60 minutes (00 to 59). This is simpler because it covers a full range of 0-59.\nLet's consider the tens digit (M1) and the units digit (M2) for each minute.\n\n*   **M1 (Tens Digit of Minute):**\n    *   '0' appears 10 times (in 00, 01, ..., 09)\n    *   '1' appears 10 times (in 10, 11, ..., 19)\n    *   '2' appears 10 times (in 20, 21, ..., 29)\n    *   '3' appears 10 times (in 30, 31, ..., 39)\n    *   '4' appears 10 times (in 40, 41, ..., 49)\n    *   '5' appears 10 times (in 50, 51, ..., 59)\n    *   (Other digits: 0 times)\n\n*   **M2 (Units Digit of Minute):**\n    *   In each decade (00-09, 10-19, ..., 50-59), each digit (0-9) appears once.\n    *   Since there are 6 such decades (00s, 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s), each units digit appears 6 times.\n    *   So, '0' appears 6 times, '1' appears 6 times, ..., '9' appears 6 times.\n\n*   **Total Occurrences for each digit in the MM part across 60 minutes:**\n    *   Digit 0: 10 (M1) + 6 (M2) = 16 times\n    *   Digit 1: 10 (M1) + 6 (M2) = 16 times\n    *   Digit 2: 10 (M1) + 6 (M2) = 16 times\n    *   Digit 3: 10 (M1) + 6 (M2) = 16 times\n    *   Digit 4: 10 (M1) + 6 (M2) = 16 times\n    *   Digit 5: 10 (M1) + 6 (M2) = 16 times\n    *   Digit 6: 0 (M1) + 6 (M2) = 6 times\n    *   Digit 7: 0 (M1) + 6 (M2) = 6 times\n    *   Digit 8: 0 (M1) + 6 (M2) = 6 times\n    *   Digit 9: 0 (M1) + 6 (M2) = 6 times\n\n---\n\n### Total Counts for Each Digit\n\nNow, we combine the two sets of counts. For each of the 24 hours, the minute digits (MM) go through all 60 variations. For each of the 60 minutes, the hour digits (HH) go through all 24 variations.\n\nTotal Count for Digit D = (Count of D in HH) * 60 (minutes) + (Count of D in MM) * 24 (hours)\n\n*   **Digit 0:** (13 * 60) + (16 * 24) = 780 + 384 = **1164**\n*   **Digit 1:** (13 * 60) + (16 * 24) = 780 + 384 = **1164**\n*   **Digit 2:** (7 * 60) + (16 * 24) = 420 + 384 = **804**\n*   **Digit 3:** (3 * 60) + (16 * 24) = 180 + 384 = **564**\n*   **Digit 4:** (2 * 60) + (16 * 24) = 120 + 384 = **504**\n*   **Digit 5:** (2 * 60) + (16 * 24) = 120 + 384 = **504**\n*   **Digit 6:** (2 * 60) + (6 * 24) = 120 + 144 = **264**\n*   **Digit 7:** (2 * 60) + (6 * 24) = 120 + 144 = **264**\n*   **Digit 8:** (2 * 60) + (6 * 24) = 120 + 144 = **264**\n*   **Digit 9:** (2 * 60) + (6 * 24) = 120 + 144 = **264**\n\nLet's quickly sum these up to verify: 1164 + 1164 + 804 + 564 + 504 + 504 + 264 + 264 + 264 + 264 = 5760. This matches our total number of digits displayed!\n\n---\n\n### Most Common and Rarest Digits\n\nBased on the total counts:\n\n*   **Most Common Digit(s):** Digits **0** and **1** (appearing 1164 times each).\n*   **Rarest Digit(s):** Digits **6**, **7**, **8**, and **9** (appearing 264 times each).\n\n---\n\n### Percentage Calculation\n\nTotal digits = 5760.\n\n*   **Percentage of Most Common Digits (0 and 1):**\n    *   (1164 / 5760) * 100% = **20.21%** (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n*   **Percentage of Rarest Digits (6, 7, 8, and 9):**\n    *   (264 / 5760) * 100% = **4.58%** (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n*   The **most common digits** are **0** and **1**, each appearing 1164 times, which is **20.21%** of all digits displayed.\n*   The **rarest digits** are **6, 7, 8,** and **9**, each appearing 264 times, which is **4.58%** of all digits displayed."
