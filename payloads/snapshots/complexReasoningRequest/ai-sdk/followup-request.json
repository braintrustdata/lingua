There are 24 × 60 = 1,440 times, each having 4 digits (HHMM), so there are 4 × 1,440 = 5,760 digit occurrences in total.\n\nCount by position:\n- H1 (tens of hour): 0 appears 600 times, 1 appears 600, 2 appears 240; others 0.\n- H2 (hour units): 0,1,2,3 each 180 times; 4–9 each 120 times.\n- M1 (tens of minute): 0–5 each 240 times; 6–9 none.\n- M2 (minute units): each digit 0–9 appears 144 times.\n\nTotal per digit (sum over all positions):\n- 0: 1,164\n- 1: 1,164\n- 2: 804\n- 3: 564\n- 4: 504\n- 5: 504\n- 6: 264\n- 7: 264\n- 8: 264\n- 9: 264\n\nThus:\n- The most common digits are 0 and 1, each appearing 1,164 times out of 5,760 digit spots, i.e. 1,164/5,760 ≈ 20.21%.\n- The rarest digits are 6, 7, 8, and 9, each appearing 264 times, i.e. 264/5,760 ≈ 4.58%.\n\nSo the clock most often shows 0 or 1 in its digits, and least often shows 6–9."
