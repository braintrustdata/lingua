If engineering gets a 10% budget increase, sales gets 15%, and admin gets 5%, and the total budget was originally $1M, what's the new total budget if each department's budget is proportional to their headcount?"

          "text": "I need to find the new total budget after department-specific increases, where each department's original budget is proportional to their headcount.\n\nFirst, let me determine the headcount for each department:\n- Engineering: 60% of 100 = 60 employees\n- Sales: 25% of 100 = 25 employees\n- Administration: 100% - 60% - 25% = 15% of 100 = 15 employees\n\nSince budgets are proportional to headcount, the original budget allocation is:\n- Engineering: (60/100) × $1M = $600,000\n- Sales: (25/100) × $1M = $250,000\n- Administration: (15/100) × $1M = $150,000\n\nNow I'll calculate each department's new budget after their respective increases:\n- Engineering: $600,000 × 1.10 = $660,000\n- Sales: $250,000 × 1.15 = $287,500\n- Administration: $150,000 × 1.05 = $157,500\n\nThe new total budget is:\n$660,000 + $287,500 + $157,500 = $1,105,000\n\nTherefore, the new total budget is $1.105 million."
