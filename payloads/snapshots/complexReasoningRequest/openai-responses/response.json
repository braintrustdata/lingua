For each digit position—tens of hours, ones of hours, tens of minutes, and ones of minutes—I must consider how each position varies. For hours, the tens can only be 0, 1, or 2, while minutes have a broader range. I’ll compute counts for all 1,440 times to better understand this distribution."

For instance, digit 0 appears 1,164 times when I sum counts from all positions. Similarly, digit 1 also totals 1,164.
