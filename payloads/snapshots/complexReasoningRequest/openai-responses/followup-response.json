For H2=0, it’s in the hours 00, 10, and 20, giving me three occurrences, which means it shows up 180 times across 24 hours. The same applies for H2=1, 2, and 3 — each appears 180 times too. However, for H2=4, it only occurs in hours 04 and 14, giving 120 occurrences."

When I look at M1, the tens digit of minutes from 00 to 59, I find it ranges from 0 to 5. Each digit occurs 60 times per hour, so over 24 hours that’s 240 occurrences. For M2, the unit digits 0 to 9 appear 6 times each per hour, leading to 144 occurrences for each digit across the full day."

One option is to visualize the distributions with a bar graph or create some code to verify my findings. I could also explore the variation by including the colon as a character. The colon occurs 1,440 times, which doesn't change the digit counts but might affect the distribution. However, the user specifically asked which digit is the most and least common."

The results show that 0 and 1 are the most common digits, while 6-9 are the least common.

It’s a good way to confirm the numbers and see the same 0/1 as most common and 6–9 as rare.\n\n- Extend the clock\n  - Add seconds (HH:MM:SS) for a full day: there are 24×60×60 = 86,400 times, i.e., 6 digits per time. Count digits across all 6 positions and compare which digits are most/least frequent.\n  - Try a 12-hour format (01:00–12:59, repeated for AM/PM).
