The hour digit repeats 24 times in the sequence (from 00:00 to 23:59).\n\nHere is the count of each hour digit:\n0: 24\n1: 24\n2: 24\n3: 24\n4: 24\n5: 24\n6: 24\n7: 24\n8: 24\n9: 24\n\nSince each digit appears 24 times, they all have the same frequency of 24/100 = 24%.\n\nFor the minutes, there are also 10 possible digits from 0 to 9. Each minute digit repeats 60 times in the sequence (from 00:00 to 59:59), as the minutes reset every hour.\n\nHere is the count of each minute digit:\n0: 60\n1: 60\n2: 60\n3: 60\n4: 60\n5: 60\n6: 60\n7: 54 (since there are no 57 minutes or 63 minutes)\n8: 54 (since there are no 58 minutes or 62 minutes)\n9: 54 (since there are no 59 minutes)\n\nThe digits 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 have a frequency of 60/100 = 60%, and the digits 3, 7, 8, 9 have a frequency of 54/60 = 90% (or 54/100 = 90%).\n\nSo, for minutes, the most common digits are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, with a frequency of 60%, and the rarest digits are 3, 7, 8, and 9, with a frequency of 90%. The frequency difference between the most common and rarest digits is 30% (90% - 60%).",
