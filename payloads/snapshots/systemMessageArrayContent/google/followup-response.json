It seems my previous response was cut off.\n\nTo answer \"What errors occurred recently?\" from the `project_logs` (id `abc-123`), you should query the `project_logs` for entries where the `level` is 'error' or similar, and sort by `timestamp` in descending order.\n\nHere's an example of what that query might look like in a hypothetical log querying language or SQL (you'd adapt this to your actual log management system):\n\n```sql\nSELECT timestamp, message, project_id, level\nFROM project_logs\nWHERE level = 'error'"
