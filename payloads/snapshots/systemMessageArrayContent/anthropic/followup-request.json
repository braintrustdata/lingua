Extend the time range (e.g., last week)?\n2. Filter by specific error types or sources?\n3. Group errors by frequency to show the most common issues?\n4. Include additional context like user IDs or request IDs if available?\n\nPlease let me know if you need the query adjusted or if you'd like me to analyze the results in a specific way!"
