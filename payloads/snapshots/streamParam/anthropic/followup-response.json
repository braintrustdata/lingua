Here are a few ways to think about it:\n\n- **If you're looking for something productive:** Maybe tackle a task you've been putting off, learn something new, or organize a space around you\n- **If you want to relax:** Read a book, take a walk, listen to music, or call someone you care about\n- **If you're feeling stuck:** Try writing down what's on your mind, or do something small that usually makes you feel good\n\nIs there a particular area of your life you're thinking about, or are you just looking for general inspiration for how to spend your time?"
