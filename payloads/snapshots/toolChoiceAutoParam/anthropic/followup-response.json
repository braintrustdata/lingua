For example:\n\n- Are you asking about what to do next in your day/schedule?\n- Are you looking for next steps on a particular project or task?\n- Are you seeking general life advice or direction?\n- Are you asking about something specific we were discussing?\n\nCould you provide a bit more detail about what situation or area of your life you're thinking about? That way I can give you more targeted and useful suggestions!"
