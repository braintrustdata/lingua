That blue comes from Rayleigh scattering, where sunlight hits the atmosphere and blue light scatters in all directions.\n\nOther times:\n- Sunrise/sunset: red, orange, pink\n- Cloudy days: gray or white\n- Night: dark/black (with stars)\n- Occasionally: greenish during severe storms or visible colors from auroras\n\nIf you share your location and time, I can describe the sky color more specifically for now."
