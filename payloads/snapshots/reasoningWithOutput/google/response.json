            "text": "The sky is most commonly **blue** during the day.\n\nThis is due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Sunlight contains all the colors of the rainbow. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, the shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more efficiently by the tiny nitrogen and oxygen molecules than the longer wavelengths (like red and yellow). Because blue light is scattered in all directions, it makes the sky appear blue to our eyes.\n\nHowever, the sky's color can vary greatly depending on several factors:\n\n*   **Sunrise and Sunset:** It often appears **red, orange, pink, or purple**. At these times, the sun's light has to travel through more of the atmosphere, scattering away most of the blue light, leaving the longer red and yellow wavelengths to reach our eyes.\n*   **Clouds:** On cloudy or stormy days, the sky can appear **grey** or even **white**.\n*   **Night:** At night, without the sun's light, the sky appears **black** (though we can see stars).\n*   **Pollution/Haze:** In some conditions, pollution or haze can give the sky a brownish, yellowish, or dull white tint.\n\nSo, while **blue** is the most typical answer, it's definitely not the only color the sky can be!"
