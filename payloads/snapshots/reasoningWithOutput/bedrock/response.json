This happens because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, where shorter blue wavelengths of sunlight scatter more in Earth's atmosphere than longer red wavelengths.\n\nHowever, the sky can appear different colors depending on conditions:\n- **Orange or red** during sunrise and sunset\n- **Gray or white** on cloudy days\n- **Deep blue or purple** at high altitudes\n- **Black** at night (in space, the sky is always black)"
