Tell me which one fits, or share your goal and location and I’ll tailor it:\n\n- Quick check now: want me to tell you the sky color right this moment? If you share your city (or a rough location) and the time, I can describe the current sky conditions.\n- Photography: want tips for capturing sky colors (golden hour, blue hour, sunsets, or clouds)? I can give camera settings, composition ideas, and gear tips.\n- Learn the science: curious to dive a bit deeper into why the sky colors change? I can give a short explanation of Rayleigh scattering and related phenomena.\n- Plan outdoor activity: need sunrise/sunset times or weather info for today? I can help you plan a walk, photography session, or stargazing.\n- Fun mini activity: quick science or art project you can do now (e.g., observe colors for 5 minutes, make a color palette from the sky, simple experiments with light).\n\nWhat would you like to do? If you share your location and goal, I’ll tailor it.",
