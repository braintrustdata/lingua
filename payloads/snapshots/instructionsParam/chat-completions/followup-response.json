If you’re not sure yet, here are general next steps you can try:\n\n- Define a clear goal and the desired outcome.\n- Break the goal into 2–5 concrete tasks or milestones.\n- Gather the resources or information you’ll need.\n- Start with the first task, set a short deadline, and begin.\n- Create a simple plan or checklist to track progress.\n- Review what you learned and adjust the plan as needed.\n\nIf you tell me your area (study, coding, writing, planning a project, etc.), I’ll tailor the steps to fit.",
