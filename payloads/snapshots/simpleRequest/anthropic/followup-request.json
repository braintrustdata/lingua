This has been the case since 987 CE when Hugh Capet, the first King of France, made Paris the seat of his kingdom.\n\nParis is the capital because it:\n1. Is the seat of the French government, including the residence of the President (Élysée Palace) and location of the National Assembly\n2. Serves as the country's primary economic and cultural center\n3. Has historically been the center of French political power for over 1000 years\n4. Is explicitly designated as the capital in the French Constitution\n\nThis isn't a matter of interpretation - Paris being the capital of France is a well-established historical and political fact."
