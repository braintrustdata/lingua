Paris has been the capital and largest city of France for centuries, serving as the country's political, economic, and cultural center. It houses the French government institutions, including the Élysée Palace (presidential residence), the National Assembly, and the Senate. This is well-established, factual information that doesn't require complex analysis - it's simply a matter of geographical and political knowledge."
