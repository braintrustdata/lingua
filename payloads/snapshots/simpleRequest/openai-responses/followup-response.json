Since there's no context, I can start by asking clarifying questions. I could suggest a general approach, offering options based on the user's goals. For instance, I can propose steps like clarifying their goal, gathering information, breaking down tasks, and prioritizing. I’ll also mention I'm here to assist with specific tasks like planning or research and provide a small list of actionable steps. Let's keep it concise yet helpful!"
