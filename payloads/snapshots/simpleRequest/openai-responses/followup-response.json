First, I can help define their goal and suggest actions based on their context. For instance, if they're studying geography or feeling stuck, I could ask what they're trying to achieve. I could mention potential directions like planning a trip to Paris or learning about France. I'll also suggest a simple framework for decision-making, providing a quick template. Let's get started on that!"
