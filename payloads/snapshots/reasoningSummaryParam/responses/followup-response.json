Options could include solving more arithmetic problems, tackling word problems, or exploring concepts. If they want to stick to arithmetic, I could suggest a few simple problems like 7+5, 9-4, or 12*3. However, I realize it might be better to structure their learning, starting with addition and moving to multiplication or fractions.\n\nSince the initial question about 2+2 was straightforward, I wonder if they’re just testing my ability to suggest next steps. I'll ask them, \"What would you like to do next?\""
