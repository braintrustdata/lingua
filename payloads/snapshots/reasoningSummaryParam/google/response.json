It's fundamental, almost trivial. My primary goal here is to provide the answer as efficiently and clearly as possible. There's no need for elaborate explanations or contextualization – the user is likely already well-versed in this area. A simple, correct statement of the fact is all that's required. I'll focus on delivering that with absolute clarity.\n",
