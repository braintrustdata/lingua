Tell me which one fits, or describe your task and any constraints and I’ll propose a concrete plan.\n\n- Plan or organize something: define your goal, break into steps, and set a timeline.\n- Learn or explain something: a short, beginner-friendly explanation or a quick micro-lesson.\n- Create or edit: draft or polish writing, code, or a presentation outline.\n- Decide or troubleshoot: compare options, weigh pros/cons, and suggest a decision.\n\nIf you prefer, share a bit about your current goal or task and I’ll propose a 1–2 step next action.",
