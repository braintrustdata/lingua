Here are a few ways to think about it:\n\n- If you have a specific project or task you're working on, you could tell me about it and I can help you brainstorm next steps\n- If you're looking for something productive to do, you might consider learning something new, organizing something, or working on a personal goal\n- If you want to have a conversation, you could ask me about a topic you're curious about\n- If you're just experimenting with this chat, feel free to ask me anything you'd like to know\n\nWhat sounds most interesting to you right now?"
