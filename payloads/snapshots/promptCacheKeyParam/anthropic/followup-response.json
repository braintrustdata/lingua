Here are a few ways to think about it:\n\n- **If you have a specific goal or project in mind**: Break it down into smaller, manageable steps and tackle the first one.\n\n- **If you're looking for something productive to do**: Consider tasks like learning something new, organizing your space, exercising, or reaching out to someone you care about.\n\n- **If you're feeling stuck or uncertain**: Sometimes taking a short break, going for a walk, or doing something creative can help clarify your thoughts.\n\n- **If you want to chat more**: Feel free to tell me about what's on your mind or ask about anything you're curious about.\n\nWhat feels most relevant to where you are right now?"
