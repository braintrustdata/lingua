For example:\n\n*   **What were you just doing, or what were you thinking about?** (e.g., \"I just finished work,\" \"I was browsing the internet,\" \"I just had a great idea for a project.\")\n*   **Are you feeling stuck, bored, overwhelmed, excited, or something else?**\n*   **What area of your life are you thinking about?** (e.g., work, personal life, a specific project, a hobby, relationships, health, finances)\n*   **What are you trying to achieve?** (e.g., relax, be productive, learn something new, solve a problem, have fun)\n*   **How much time do you have?** (e.g., 5 minutes, an hour, the rest of the day)\n*   **What resources are available to you?** (e.g., computer, outdoors, money, other people)\n\nOnce you give me a little more information, I can help you brainstorm some ideas!"
