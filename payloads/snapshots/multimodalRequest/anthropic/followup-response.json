Here are some possibilities depending on what context you're thinking about:\n\n**If you're playing a Pokémon game:**\n- Train your Bulbasaur by battling wild Pokémon or trainers\n- Explore the area for items or other Pokémon\n- Head to the next gym or story objective\n- Try to catch more Pokémon to build your team\n\n**If you're just browsing Pokémon content:**\n- Look up Bulbasaur's evolution line (Ivysaur → Venusaur)\n- Check out other Generation 1 starter Pokémon\n- Read about Bulbasaur's abilities and movesets\n\n**If you're doing something else entirely:**\n- Let me know what specific situation or activity you're referring to!\n\nWhat did you have in mind? I'd be happy to give more targeted advice if you can share more context about what you're doing or trying to accomplish."
