Tell me:\n\n*   **What's your current mood?** (Energetic, tired, bored, restless, focused?)\n*   **How much time do you have?** (5 minutes, an hour, all day?)\n*   **What did you just finish doing?** (Work, relaxing, eating, chores?)\n*   **Are you looking for something productive, relaxing, creative, social, or just to kill time?**\n*   **What are your general interests?**\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few general ideas:\n\n*   **Take a short break:** Stand up, stretch, get a drink of water.\n*   **Listen to some music or a podcast.**\n*   **Plan out your next hour or day.**\n*   **Quickly tidy a small area around you.**\n*   **Learn something new:** Read an interesting article or watch a short educational video.\n*   **Engage your creativity:** Doodle, free-write, or brainstorm some ideas.\n*   **Talk to me more!** Ask me another question, tell me about your day, or brainstorm something with me.\n\nOnce I know a bit more, I can give you a more tailored recommendation!"
