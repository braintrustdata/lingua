Here are a few ways to think about it:\n\n**If you're looking for something to do right now:**\n- What sounds appealing - something productive, relaxing, creative, or social?\n- Any tasks or responsibilities you've been putting off?\n- Something you've been wanting to learn or try?\n\n**If you're thinking bigger picture:**\n- What are your current goals or priorities?\n- Is there something you've been meaning to work toward?\n- Any decisions you've been weighing?\n\nWhat context were you thinking about? I'd be happy to help you brainstorm once I know more about your situation!"
