The blues range from deep, dark navy tones in the stormy clouds and turbulent ocean waves to lighter blue-greens in parts of the water. The whites appear in the ship's sails, the lightning bolts, sea foam, and the lighter portions of the dramatic clouds. There are also some **gray tones** in the storm clouds and the ship itself. The overall effect creates a monochromatic, stormy seascape with cool tones dominating the composition."
