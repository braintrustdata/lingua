Here are some options to get started:\n\n1. **If you want to explore what files are available:**\n   - Tell me a directory path to view (e.g., `/home/user/project` or `/repo`)\n   - I can show you what files and folders exist\n\n2. **If you have a specific file in mind:**\n   - Provide the file path and I can view its contents\n   - Then you can tell me what changes you'd like to make\n\n3. **If you want to create a new file:**\n   - Tell me the path where you want to create it\n   - Let me know what content should go in it\n\n4. **If you're working on a coding project:**\n   - Tell me about the project and what you're trying to accomplish\n   - I can help you edit existing code or create new files\n\nCould you tell me:\n- What type of project or task are you working on?\n- Do you have a specific directory or file you want to work with?\n- What's your end goal?\n\nThis will help me guide you on the best next steps!"
