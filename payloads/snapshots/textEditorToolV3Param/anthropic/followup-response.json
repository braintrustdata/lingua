Here are some options for what you can do next:\n\n1. **If you have a specific file in mind:**\n   - Tell me the file path (e.g., `/home/user/document.txt` or `./my_script.py`)\n   - Let me know what changes you want to make\n\n2. **If you want to explore what files are available:**\n   - Give me a directory path to view (e.g., `/home/user/` or `.` for current directory)\n\n3. **If you want to create a new file:**\n   - Tell me the desired file path and name\n   - Provide the content you want in the file\n\n4. **Common editing tasks I can help with:**\n   - View file contents\n   - Replace specific text\n   - Insert new lines of code/text\n   - Create new files from scratch\n\nCould you tell me more about what you're trying to accomplish? For example:\n- \"I want to edit `/path/to/my/file.txt`\"\n- \"Show me what files are in the current directory\"\n- \"I want to create a new Python script\"\n- \"I need to replace some text in a configuration file\""
