Here are some options:\n\n1. **Practice another problem** - I can give you a similar average speed problem to solve\n\n2. **Explore related concepts** - We could discuss:\n   - Average velocity (which considers direction)\n   - How to calculate time if you know distance and speed\n   - Acceleration problems\n\n3. **Apply this to a real scenario** - Calculate average speeds for:\n   - A trip you're planning\n   - A commute you take regularly\n   - A road trip scenario\n\n4. **Move to a different topic** - Let me know what subject interests you\n\n5. **Ask a follow-up question** - Do you have any questions about this problem or how average speed works?\n\nWhat sounds most helpful to you?"
