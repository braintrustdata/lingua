Here are some common options:\n\n## If you want to **continue learning**:\n- Practice with another average speed problem\n- Learn about other motion concepts (acceleration, velocity, relative speed)\n- Explore distance/time/speed relationships\n\n## If you want to **apply this knowledge**:\n- Use it for real trip planning (calculate average speeds on your routes)\n- Solve other physics problems\n- Study for a test or class\n\n## If you want to **try something different**:\n- Ask about a completely different topic\n- Get help with homework or another subject\n- Work through another word problem\n\n**What interests you most?** I'm happy to help with whatever you'd like to tackle next!"
