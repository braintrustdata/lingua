Here are some options:\n\n1. **Practice similar problems** - Try calculating average speed with different speeds and times to reinforce the concept\n\n2. **Explore related concepts** - Learn about:\n   - Distance = Speed × Time problems\n   - Acceleration and deceleration\n   - Relative speed (two objects moving)\n\n3. **Real-world applications** - Apply this to:\n   - Planning a road trip\n   - Analyzing commute times\n   - Comparing travel routes\n\n4. **More complex scenarios** - Try problems with:\n   - More than 2 segments\n   - Finding missing values (e.g., \"what speed for 1 hour to reach avg of 70 mph?\")\n\n5. **Move to a different topic** - Work on something entirely new\n\n**What interests you most?** Let me know and I can help you work through it!"
