The formula for average speed is:\n\n**Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time**\n\nLet's break down the train's journey into two parts:\n\n**Part 1: First Leg of the Journey**\n1.  **Speed:** 60 mph\n2.  **Time:** 2 hours\n3.  **Calculate Distance for Part 1:**\n    *   Distance = Speed × Time\n    *   Distance_1 = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles\n\n**Part 2: Second Leg of the Journey**\n1.  **Speed:** 80 mph\n2.  **Time:** 1 hour\n3.  **Calculate Distance for Part 2:**\n    *   Distance = Speed × Time\n    *   Distance_2 = 80 mph × 1 hour = 80 miles\n\n**Now, let's calculate the Total Distance and Total Time:**\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Distance:**\n    *   Total Distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2\n    *   Total Distance = 120 miles + 80 miles = 200 miles\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Time:**\n    *   Total Time = Time_1 + Time_2\n    *   Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours\n\n**Finally, calculate the Average Speed:**\n\n6.  **Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time**\n    *   Average Speed = 200 miles / 3 hours\n    *   Average Speed ≈ 66.67 mph\n\nThe average speed of the train is **66 2/3 mph** or approximately **66.67 mph**."
