The formula for average speed is:\n\n**Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time**\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the distance for the first part of the journey.**\n*   Speed = 60 mph\n*   Time = 2 hours\n*   Distance = Speed × Time\n*   Distance₁ = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the distance for the second part of the journey.**\n*   Speed = 80 mph\n*   Time = 1 hour\n*   Distance = Speed × Time\n*   Distance₂ = 80 mph × 1 hour = 80 miles\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.**\n*   Total Distance = Distance₁ + Distance₂\n*   Total Distance = 120 miles + 80 miles = 200 miles\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total time taken.**\n*   Total Time = Time₁ + Time₂\n*   Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the average speed.**\n*   Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n*   Average Speed = 200 miles / 3 hours\n*   Average Speed = 66.666... mph\n\n**Answer:**\nThe average speed of the train is **66 and 2/3 mph** (or approximately 66.67 mph)."
