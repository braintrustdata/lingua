        "content": "Nice work solving it. Here are some good next steps depending on what you want:\n\n- Quick concept recap: The average speed is total distance divided by total time. It’s a weighted average, not just the simple average of speeds, unless the times are equal.\n\n- Practice problems you can try (I can walk through solutions if you want):\n  1) A car goes 50 mph for 3 hours, then 70 mph for 1 hour. What’s the average speed?\n     - Hint: Distances = 50×3 = 150 miles; 70×1 = 70 miles; total = 220 miles. Total time = 4 hours. Average speed = 220/4 = 55 mph.\n  2) A runner runs at 6 mph for 0.5 hours, then 8 mph for 0.75 hours. What’s the average speed?\n     - Hint: Distances = 6×0.5 = 3 miles; 8×0.75 = 6 miles; total = 9 miles. Total time = 1.25 hours. Average speed = 9/1.25 = 7.2 mph.\n\n- Deepen understanding (optional):\n  - How to generalize for n legs: average speed = sum(v_i × t_i) / sum(t_i), where v_i is speed in leg i and t_i is its time.\n\n- If you want, I can tailor more problems to your level or walk you through other scenarios (different times, same distance, etc.). What would you like to do next?",
