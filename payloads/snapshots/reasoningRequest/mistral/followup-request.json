      "content": "To find the average speed, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled and then divide it by the total time taken.\n\n1. First, let's find the distance traveled during the first 2 hours at 60 mph:\n   Distance1 = Speed1 * Time1\n   Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles\n\n2. Next, let's find the distance traveled during the next 1 hour at 80 mph:\n   Distance2 = Speed2 * Time2\n   Distance2 = 80 mph * 1 hour = 80 miles\n\n3. Now, let's find the total distance traveled:\n   Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2\n   Total distance = 120 miles + 80 miles = 200 miles\n\n4. The total time taken is the sum of the individual times:\n   Total time = Time1 + Time2\n   Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours\n\n5. Finally, let's find the average speed:\n   Average speed = Total distance / Total time\n   Average speed = 200 miles / 3 hours ≈ 66.67 mph (approximately)\n\nSo, the average speed of the train is approximately 66.67 mph.",
