Here are some options:\n\n1. **Practice similar problems** - Try calculating average speed with different distances, speeds, or time periods\n\n2. **Learn related concepts** - Explore topics like:\n   - Average velocity (including direction)\n   - Acceleration\n   - Distance-time graphs\n\n3. **Solve a different problem** - Ask me another math, science, or homework question\n\n4. **Go deeper into this problem** - For example:\n   - What if the train continued at a different speed?\n   - How would you find the time needed to travel a certain distance at this average speed?\n\n5. **Move on to something else entirely** - I'm happy to help with whatever you need\n\n**What sounds most helpful to you?** Let me know and I'll guide you through it!"
