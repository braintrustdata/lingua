Here are some possibilities:\n\n**If this is part of studying physics/math:**\n- Try a similar problem with different speeds and times\n- Practice related concepts like acceleration or relative motion\n- Work on other physics problems you need to complete\n\n**If this is homework:**\n- Move on to the next problem in your assignment\n- Review your answers before submitting\n- Check if there are any other subjects you need to work on\n\n**If you're just learning:**\n- Try creating your own average speed problems\n- Explore related topics like weighted averages\n- Take a break if you've been studying for a while\n\n**If you have other questions:**\n- Feel free to ask about anything else you're curious about or need help with\n\nWhat context were you working in? I'd be happy to suggest more specific next steps!"
