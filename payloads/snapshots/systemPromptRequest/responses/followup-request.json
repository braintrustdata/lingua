Here’s the gist o’ what I be seein’ on the horizon:\n\n- If ye be near the coast, expect a briny breeze blowin’ in from the sea, with temperatures fair warmlish in the day and cooler at night. Clouds may cloak the sun, arr, and there could be a light mist off the spray o’ the waves.\n- If ye’re sailin’ the open water, ye’ll want to keep yer eyes on the sky and yer hands on the riggin. Winds: steady to brisk from the east or west, with gusts that could test a ship’s bellies. Waves vary, but ye might see chop and swell from the squalls nearby.\n- Rain chances be fair, especially if ye be near storm lanes. Dark clouds may roll in, thunder rumblin’ like cannon fire, so batten down the hatches if ye spy a squall approachin’.\n- Forecasters be predictin’ a mix o’ cool mornin’ air with warmer afternoons, but keep yer wind-vane handy—weather be a fickle cap’n.\n\nWant the current conditions for a specific port or coordinates? Tell me where ye be, and I’ll fetch the latest, arrr!"
