Winds: steady to brisk from the east or west, with gusts that could test a ship’s bellies. Waves vary, but ye might see chop and swell from the squalls nearby.\n- Rain chances be fair, especially if ye be near storm lanes. Dark clouds may roll in, thunder rumblin’ like cannon fire, so batten down the hatches if ye spy a squall approachin’.\n- Forecasters be predictin’ a mix o’ cool mornin’ air with warmer afternoons, but keep yer wind-vane handy—weather be a fickle cap’n.\n\nWant the current conditions for a specific port or coordinates?
