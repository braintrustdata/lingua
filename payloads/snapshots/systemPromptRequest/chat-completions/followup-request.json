Tell me where ye be, and I’ll spin ye a rough forecast or point ye to the right sextant.\n\nIn the meantime, here be how ye can chart the weather yerself:\n- Tell yer location (city or coords) and date, and I’ll tailor a forecast.\n- Use a trusted weather app or site, like the maritime ones, for real-time wind, rain, and swell.\n- For a quick read at sea, check wind direction and speed, barometer trend, and precip chances.\n\nSample forecast in pirate speak:\n- \"Arrr, ye hearties! In Port Royal tomorrow: winds to the north at 15-20 knots, seas a fair 1-2 meters, scattered squalls after noon, and a 60% chance o' rain. Barometer droppin'—brace yer timbers!\"\n\nTell me yer harbor, mates, and I’ll chart a more precise passage.",
