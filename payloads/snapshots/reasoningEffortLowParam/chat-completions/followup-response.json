In the meantime, here are some generic “what to do next” templates you can use:\n\n- If you’re trying to make progress on a project:\n  1) Define your next milestone (specific, measurable).\n  2) List the concrete steps needed to reach it.\n  3) Pick the first step and do it for 25–50 minutes (time-box).\n  4) Review what happened, adjust, and repeat.\n\n- If you’re feeling stuck or overwhelmed:\n  1) Write down the top 3 tasks that matter most.\n  2) Break them into tiny actions (2–5 minutes each).\n  3) Do one small action now, then reassess.\n\n- If you’re learning something new:\n  1) Set a learning goal for today (e.g., “watch 1 lesson and take notes”).\n  2) Do a quick recall exercise (summarize what you learned from memory).\n  3) Practice with a small example or quiz.\n\n- If you’re deciding what to do next:\n  1) List 3 options with pros/cons.\n  2) Choose the option with the highest impact and lowest effort, or do a quick 5-minute test.\n\n- If you want a routine or daily plan:\n  1) Pick 3 non-negotiables for the day.\n  2) Schedule focused blocks for deep work.\n  3) End with a quick reflection: what went well, what to adjust tomorrow.\n\nIf you can share a bit more about your goal, I can suggest a precise next step.",
