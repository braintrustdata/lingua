This is a very open-ended question that I can't answer meaningfully without more information.\n\nI should ask for clarification about what context they're referring to - are they asking about a specific task, project, life decision, or something else entirely? I want to be helpful but I need more information to give useful guidance.",

Could you tell me more about what you're working on or what context you're asking about? For example:\n\n- Are you working on a specific project or task?\n- Are you looking for general life advice?\n- Are you trying to solve a problem?\n- Are you planning your day or schedule?\n\nWith more details, I can give you much more helpful suggestions!"
