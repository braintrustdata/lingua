Here are a few ways to think about it:\n\n- If you're studying math, you might try more addition problems or move on to other operations\n- If you're just getting started with something, consider what your main objective is\n- If you're feeling stuck or bored, maybe take a short break or switch to a different activity\n\nWhat were you hoping to accomplish, or what's on your mind right now? That would help me give you a more useful suggestion!"
