If you’re not sure, here are quick options you can pick from (or mix):\n\n- Plan a project or task: define goal, milestones, timeline.\n- Learn something new: a focused mini-course with key topics and resources.\n- Write something: create an outline, draft, and revision steps.\n- Make a decision: list options, criteria, pros/cons, and a ranking.\n- Solve a problem: diagnose, brainstorm solutions, and pick a plan.\n- Code/tech task: gather requirements, propose architecture, and sample code.\n- Organize something: priorities, to-do list, and schedule.\n\nIf you want, we can start with a quick prompt: describe your goal in one sentence and list the top 3 outcomes you want. Any deadline or constraints?\n\nTell me which option fits, or share your goal and I’ll generate a concrete plan right away.",
