          "text": "**My Initial Assessment and Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to \"solve a complex problem.\" That's the request, but it's completely open-ended. I need more information! It's clear that the user is expecting a solution, but without knowing the actual *problem*, I'm stuck.\n\nI need to be proactive and figure out how to get the user to give me what I need. I want to avoid being overly blunt – just saying \"Tell me the problem\" feels a bit... robotic. I need to be helpful and encourage them to provide the context.\n\nI'll craft a thoughtful response that achieves a few key things: I need to acknowledge the request, make it clear that the core problem details are missing, and *ask* for the details in a way that’s encouraging. I should also give them a nudge, a hint that can help them get their problem written. To do so I will list my areas of expertise to give them ideas of the type of things I can help with.\n\nHere's how I see it unfolding:\n\n*   I'll start with a friendly greeting to acknowledge their request.\n*   I'll explicitly state that I can't proceed without the problem itself.\n*   I'll issue a direct call to action, politely asking them to provide the problem details, whether as text or a description.\n*   Finally, to encourage engagement and give them some direction, I'll list out my core capabilities. I can help with math and physics, programming, logic puzzles, data analysis, and business and creative strategy. Hopefully, that will spark some ideas and move the conversation forward.\n\n\n",
