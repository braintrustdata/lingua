My first thought is, I can't even begin until I understand *what* the problem is. I need specifics, and I need them quickly. I can't just stare into the void and hope something emerges.\n\nNow, how best to elicit this information? I've got a few approaches in mind. I could go with a **direct approach**: Just cut to the chase and ask for the specifics. \"Please provide the problem you'd like me to solve.\" Simple, efficient, and likely to get the information I need, though it might come across as a bit brusque.\n\nThen there's a **helpful approach**: Offer a welcoming invitation and provide some context. \"I'm ready to help! Please share the details of the problem (math, logic, coding, science, writing, etc.) so I can get started.\" This is friendlier, more collaborative, and might encourage the user to provide more detail. It also gives them some prompts for what sorts of things I might be good at.\n\nOr, there's a **categorical approach**: Guide the user with some options to choose from. List the types of problems I can solve to help the user identify what kind of problem they want me to tackle. A bit more work to prepare, but potentially very effective.\n\nI'll choose based on how much the user has said previously, though I'm leaning toward the \"helpful approach\" to start. Then, based on the response, I'll adapt. This is all about gathering the information I need to begin the real work!\n\n\n",
