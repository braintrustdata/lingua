            "text": "**Navigating the Unknown: A Strategic Approach**\n\nOkay, so the user is at a crossroads. They came to me with a request for assistance on a \"complex problem,\" but the problem itself is missing. Now, the question is, what should I do next? It seems they are either unsure of what to ask, testing my abilities, or maybe they are looking for a plan for an undisclosed project.\n\nTo be truly helpful, I can't just throw out random suggestions. I need to structure my response around a few potential scenarios, and this will be my approach. I'll need to consider a few different contexts: Are they struggling to formulate the question itself? Are they fishing for ideas or projects? Or are they simply looking for me to take the lead?\n\nMy response needs to be tailored to help them determine their “next move”, whether that's: defining the core goal of their project (\"North Star\"), breaking down an overly complex problem into manageable chunks, or giving me a specific area to focus on for brainstorming (Tech, Life, Work, Study).\n\nTo offer practical guidance, I will frame my response with the following framework:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Pain Point\":** What is causing the current problem?\n2.  **Identify the \"Goal\":** What do they want to achieve?\n3.  **Provide the \"Context\":** Where is this happening? What domain?\n\nI will use some interactive templates, to elicit the information I need, and provide more directed answers.\n\nCrucially, I need to keep this interaction positive and encouraging. I don't want to come across as dismissive of their current situation, so the tone needs to be upbeat and proactive.\n\n\n",

            "text": "Since I don't know the specific problem you are facing yet, the best \"next step\" is to **structure the information** so it can be solved systematically.\n\nWhether you are dealing with a technical issue, a business dilemma, or a personal project, here is a universal 3-step framework you can follow right now:\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Current State\" vs. \"Desired State\"\nWrite down two sentences:\n*   **Where are you now?** (e.g., \"I have 5,000 lines of messy code that won't run,\" or \"I need to increase sales by 20% but have no marketing budget.\")\n*   **Where do you want to be?** (e.g., \"I want a functional app,\" or \"I want a low-cost lead generation strategy.\")\n\n### Step 2: Identify the \"Primary Constraint\"\nWhat is the #1 thing stopping you?\n*   **Is it Knowledge?** (You don't know *how* to do it.)\n*   **Is it Resources?** (No time, money, or people.)\n*   **Is it Clarity?** (You have too many options and can't choose.)\n\n### Step 3: Give me a \"Starting Point\"\nPick one of the following and paste it here:\n\n1.  **The \"Data Dump\":** Paste everything you know about the problem, even if it’s unorganized. I will organize it for you.\n2.  **The \"Reverse Engineer\":** Tell me the end goal, and I will work backward to create a step-by-step checklist for you.\n3.  **The \"Devil’s Advocate\":** Tell me your current plan, and I will find the holes in it and suggest improvements.\n\n---\n\n**If you are looking for a suggestion on what to do *literally* next in your day:**\n*   Take 5 minutes to clear your desk or workspace. Physical clutter often leads to mental clutter.\n*   Then, **type the problem out to me.** Sometimes the act of explaining a problem to someone else (even an AI) helps you see the solution yourself. This is known as \"Rubber Ducking.\"\n\n**What is the problem you’re looking at right now?**",
