At sunrise and sunset, the light passes through more air, so more blue is scattered out and the sky takes on red/orange/pink hues. It can appear gray on cloudy days, and dark/black at night. In space, without atmosphere, the sky is black. If you want, tell me your location or time and I can describe the current color.",
