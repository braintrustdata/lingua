That’s because sunlight (white light) scatters off the atmosphere, and the shorter blue wavelengths scatter more than the others.\n\nColors can change:\n- Sunrise/sunset: red/orange/pink (sunlight passes through more air, longer wavelengths dominate)\n- Cloudy/overcast: gray\n- Night: dark/black (stars may be visible)\n\nSometimes, in storms the sky can look greenish-gray.\n\nIf you tell me your location and time of day, I can give a more specific guess for the sky color right now.",
