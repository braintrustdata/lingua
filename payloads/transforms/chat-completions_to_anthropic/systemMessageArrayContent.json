Let me query the data to see what errors have occurred recently.\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    timestamp,\n    level,\n    message,\n    source,\n    error_code\nFROM project_logs \nWHERE level = 'ERROR' \nORDER BY timestamp DESC \nLIMIT 20;\n```\n\nThis query will show the 20 most recent error entries, including:\n- When each error occurred\n- The error message\n- Where it came from (source)\n- Any error codes if available\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Filter by a specific time period (last hour, day, week)?\n2. Look for specific types of errors?\n3. Group errors by frequency or source?\n4. Show additional context like stack traces if available?\n\nPlease let me know what specific timeframe you're interested in or if you'd like me to focus on particular types of errors."
