This is due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, where molecules in Earth's atmosphere scatter blue light from the sun more than other colors.\n\nOf course, the sky's color can change depending on conditions - it can appear red, orange, or pink during sunrise and sunset, gray during overcast weather, or nearly black at night."
