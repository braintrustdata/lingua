This blue color is caused by a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, where molecules in Earth's atmosphere scatter blue light from the sun more than other colors.\n\nOf course, the sky can appear different colors depending on conditions - it might look gray during overcast weather, or display beautiful reds, oranges, and pinks during sunrise or sunset."
