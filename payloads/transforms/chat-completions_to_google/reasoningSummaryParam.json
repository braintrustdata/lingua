First, I need to analyze the request – it's a straightforward arithmetic query. There's no hidden complexity here, no nuanced interpretation required. Straightforward. Next, I need to retrieve the fundamental fact. It's an instant recall: 2 plus 2 equals 4. It's practically ingrained. Finally, I need to formulate the response, presenting the answer in a clear and direct manner. No embellishment needed.\n",
