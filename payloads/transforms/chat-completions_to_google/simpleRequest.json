First, I quickly identify the core task – the user is explicitly asking for the capital of France. Nothing tricky, just a direct information retrieval request. Now, I need to access my knowledge base – the data I've been trained on and the information I have readily available. I instantly scan for the relevant fact: the capital of France. The next step is simply retrieving that information. In this case, the capital of France is Paris. Finally, I need to formulate a response. Given the user's direct question, I'd want to respond concisely but completely. \"Paris\" is technically correct, but \"The capital of France is Paris\" is more thorough and directly addresses the question's phrasing. So, I'd likely choose the latter for clarity. Done!\n",
