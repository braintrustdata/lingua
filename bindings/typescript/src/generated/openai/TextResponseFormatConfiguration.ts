/**
 * An object specifying the format that the model must output.
 *
 * Configuring `{ "type": "json_schema" }` enables Structured Outputs,
 * which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the
 * [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
 *
 * The default format is `{ "type": "text" }` with no additional options.
 *
 * **Not recommended for gpt-4o and newer models:**
 *
 * Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
 * ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema`
 * is preferred for models that support it.
 *
 *
 * Default response format. Used to generate text responses.
 *
 *
 * JSON Schema response format. Used to generate structured JSON responses.
 * Learn more about [Structured
 * Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
 *
 *
 * JSON object response format. An older method of generating JSON responses.
 * Using `json_schema` is recommended for models that support it. Note that the
 * model will not generate JSON without a system or user message instructing it
 * to do so.
