 * Specify additional output data to include in the model response. Currently
 * supported values are:
 * - `web_search_call.action.sources`: Include the sources of the web search tool call.
 * - `code_interpreter_call.outputs`: Includes the outputs of python code execution
 * in code interpreter tool call items.
 * - `computer_call_output.output.image_url`: Include image urls from the computer call
 * output.
 * - `file_search_call.results`: Include the search results of
 * the file search tool call.
 * - `message.input_image.image_url`: Include image urls from the input message.
 * - `message.output_text.logprobs`: Include logprobs with assistant messages.
 * - `reasoning.encrypted_content`: Includes an encrypted version of reasoning
 * tokens in reasoning item outputs. This enables reasoning items to be used in
 * multi-turn conversations when using the Responses API statelessly (like
 * when the `store` parameter is set to `false`, or when an organization is
 * enrolled in the zero data retention program).
