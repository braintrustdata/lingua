 * - `auto`: If the input to this Response exceeds
 * the model's context window size, the model will truncate the
 * response to fit the context window by dropping items from the beginning of the
 * conversation.
 * - `disabled` (default): If the input size will exceed the context window
 * size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.
